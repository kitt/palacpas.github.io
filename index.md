The Pasadena Area Liberal Arts Center (PALAC) offers continuing liberal arts education to adults of the San Gabriel Valley If you enjoy the excitement and stimulation of discussing ideas in a new learning situation, whatever your educational background, you are welcome in any of the PALAC programs.

Many of the discussion groups are based on books; however, some are based on movies or educational tapes. There are also Mini Safaris (field trips) and social events.

Discussion groups are led by PALAC members and hosted in local homes. Most have from 4 to 6 sessions, during a weekday or in the evening.

Most groups are limited to 13 participants. Early registration will help assure you a place.  To accomodate mail delivery times, the PALAC office will hold all checks for seven days after our outlying members receive their brochures in the mail before signing anyone up. If a group is over-subscribed, we will have a random draw, with any remaining subscriptions being placed on a waitlist.
